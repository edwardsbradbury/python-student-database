# python-student-database

A student record manager written in Python for foundation year programming coursework.

The coursework brief is included but the lecturer appears to have removed the VLE (virtual learning environment) page for this assignment, so I can't access the feedback.

This coursework was completed and graded three years ago, but from what I recall, it scored 97% or 98% and the feedback was that calling the main method at the end of each function was unnecessary (because the flow of execution would naturally return to the main method anyhow) and would also become a memory drain if the program continued running for any substantial length of time.
